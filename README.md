# Arduino-RC-Car 
In this project, I developed an RC car using Arduino Uno, equipped with Bluetooth connectivity to switch between different operational modes: manual control, obstacle avoidance, and line following.
The car featured an HC-05 Bluetooth module for wireless communication, allowing users to control the car via a smartphone app.
In manual mode, users could directly control the carâ€™s movements.
The obstacle avoidance mode utilized ultrasonic sensors to detect and navigate around obstacles autonomously. 
The line follower mode employed infrared sensors to track and follow a predefined path.
# Hardware connections
Bleutooth: RX pin D02 / TX pin D03.
Right IR Sensor: pin A0 / Left IR Sensor: pin A1.
UltraSonic Sensor: Echo pin A2 / Trigger pin A3
